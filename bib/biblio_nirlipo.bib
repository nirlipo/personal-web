  abstract={Current state-of-the-art planners solve problems, easy and hard alike, by search, expanding hundreds or thousands of nodes. Yet, given the ability of people to solve easy problems and to explain their solutions, it seems that an essential inferential component may be missing. The reasons expressed by people for selecting actions appear to be related to causal chains: sequences of causal links a i→ p i+ 1, i= 0,..., n–1, such that a 0 is applicable in the current state, p i is a precondition of action a i, and p n is a goal. Some of these causal chains or paths appear to be good, some bad, others appear to be impossible. In this work, we focus on such paths and develop three techniques for performing inference over them from which a path-based planner is obtained. We define the conditions under which a path is consistent, provide an heuristic estimate of the cost of achieving the goal along a consistent path, and introduce a planning algorithm that uses paths as decomposition backbones. The resulting planner, called C3, is not complete and does not perform as well as recent planners that carry extensive but extremely efficient searches such as LAMA, but is competitive with FF and in particular, with FF running in EHC mode which yields very focused but incomplete searches, and thus provides, a more apt comparison. Moreover, many domains are solved backtrack-free, with no search at all, suggesting that planning with paths may be a meaningful idea both cognitively and computationally.}

We alsoshow that by launching one probe from each expanded statein a standard greedy best first search informed by the addi-tive heuristic, the number of problems solved jumps to 900 (92%), as opposed to FF that solves 827 problems (84%), and LAMA that solves 879 (89%).

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to introduce a different approach to the problem of inference in planning that is not based on either the extraction and use of heuristic functions or reductions into SAT or CSPs. The proposed approach is based on the new notion of consistent causal chains: sequences of causal links ai, pi+ 1, ai+ 1 starting with an action a0 applicable in the current state s and finishing in the goal, where pi+ 1 is an effect of action ai and a precondition of action ai+ 1. We show that by enforcing the semantics of causal links, it is possible to propagate side effects along such chains and detect that some of these chains cannot be part of any plan. Actions a0 that cannot start any consistent causal chain can then be pruned. We show that while simple, this pruning rule is quite powerful: a plain backtracking forward-state search planner with a version of this pruning rule solves as many benchmark problems as the effective Enforced Hill Climbing search of FF, many of them backtrack-free. We then consider extensions of this basic idea and discuss some of its implications.}

  abstract={The automatic derivation of informative heuristic functions has been a key development in modern domainindependent planning. Heuristic functions provide the search for plans with a sense of direction that allows large problems to be solved quite effectively. Heuristic search planners, on the other hand, are not transparent: it is not clear why and when they will work, it is not simple to explain, as humans do, why certain actions are selected and others are discarded, and most important of all, it is not simple to improve them in spite of their known limitations. The C3 planner approaches the problem of inference in planning from a different perspective. Rather than relying on the extraction and use of heuristic functions or reductions into SAT or CSPs, C3 prunes’ bad actions’ by appealing to the notion of consistent causal chains (Lipovetzky, Ramirez, and Geffner 2008).}

  abstract={Heuristic search has been the mainstream approach in planning for more than a decade, with planners such as FF, FD, and LAMA being able to solve problems with hundreds of actions and variables in a few seconds (Hoffmann and Nebel 2001; Helmert 2006; Richter and Westphal 2010). The basic idea behind these planners is to search for plans using a search algorithm guided by heuristic estimators derived automatically from the problem (McDermott 1996; Bonet and Geffner 2001). State-of-the-art planners, however, go well beyond this idea, adding a number of techniques that are specific to planning. These techniques, such as helpful actions and landmarks (Hoffmann and Nebel 2001; Hoffmann, Porteous, and Sebastia 2004; Richter, Helmert, and Westphal 2008), are designed to exploit the propositional structure of planning problems; a structure that is absent in traditional heuristic search where states and heuristic evaluations are used as black boxes. Moreover, new search algorithms have been devised to make use of these techniques. FF, for example, triggers a best-first search when an incomplete but effective greedy search (enforced hill climbing) that uses helpful actions only, fails. In FD and LAMA, the use of helpful or preferred operators is not restricted to the first phase of the search, but to one of the open lists maintained in a multi-queue search algorithm. In both cases, dual search architectures that appeal either to two successive searches or to a single search with multiple open lists, are aimed at solving fast, large problems that are simple, without giving up completeness on problems that are not.}

In the last few years, classical planning has also been extended to incorporate temporally extended goals, expressed in temporal logics such as LTL, to impose restrictions on the state sequences generated by finite plans. In this work, we take the next step and consider the computation of infinite plans for achieving arbitrary LTL goals. We show that infinite plans can also be obtained efficiently by calling a classical planner once over a classical planning encoding that represents and extends the composition of the planning domain and the Buchi automaton representing the goal. This compilation scheme has been implemented and a number of experiments are reported.}

both serializing the goal into subgoals and for solving the resulting
problems, resulting in a ‘blind’ planner that competes well with a
best-first search planner guided by state-of-the-art heuristics. In addition, ideas like helpful actions and landmarks can be integrated as
well, producing a planner with state-of-the-art performance.}

  abstract={We consider the problem of planning in environments where the state is fully observable, actions have non-deterministic effects, and plans must generate infinite state trajectories for achieving a large class of LTL goals. More formally, we focus on the control synthesis problem under the assumption that the LTL formula to be realized can be mapped into a deterministic Bu ̈chi automaton. We show that by assuming that action non-determinism is fair, namely that infinite executions of a non-deterministic action in the same state yield each possible successor state an infinite number of times, the (fair) synthesis problem can be reduced to a standard strong cyclic planning task over reachability goals. Since strong cyclic planners are built on top of efficient classical planners, the transformation reduces the non-deterministic, fully observable, temporally extended planning task into the solution of classical planning problems. A number of experiments are reported showing the potential benefits of this approach to synthesis in comparison with state-of-the-art symbolic methods.}

Such time-oriented resource constraintsare not traditionally handled well by automated planners. On the other hand, the remaining problem involves finding node-disjoint sequences withstate-dependent travel times on the arcs, which are highly challenging for a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP). In this paper, we address the problem of finding feasible sequences using a combined MIP and planning based decomposition approach. The MIP takes care of the resource constraints, and the planner solves the remaining sequence problem. We extend the notion of finding feasible sequences to finding good feasible sequences, by devising a heuristic objective function in the MIP, which improves the resulting search space for the planner. We empirically analyse the scalability of our approach on a benchmark data set, before demonstrating its effectiveness on a real world case study provided by our industry partner. These results demonstrate that by using a heuristic MIP, it is possible to obtain better makespan results with a suboptimal planner than by using an optimal planner with an uninformed MIP.}

Modelling (ABM) to explore the persistence of hunter-gatherer (HG) groups in semi-arid environments

the monsoon. Precipitation trends are modelled from instrumental records (1871 - 2008) calibrated with
existing models for the Asian monsoon in the Holocene (c. 12 ka - present). Experiments aim at
exploring dependencies between population dynamics and climate-driven environmental change (in
terms of resource availability) for precipitation patterns at the local, regional and continental scales.
Resources are distributed across a simplified ground-model. Average yearly precipitation (AYP, i.e.
mean) and variance in yearly precipitation (VYP, i.e. standard deviation) are the main parameters
affecting resource availability in the simulations. We assess the effects of environmental change on HG
populations at different time-scales: (1) Patterns of seasonal (inter-annual) resource availability, (2)
Effects of changes in mean precipitation trends over the long (Pleistocene-Holocene) and the mid
(Holocene, millennial) periods, and (3) Effects of intra-annual precipitation variability, i.e. changes in
standard deviation from mean precipitation trends over the short period (annual to decadal).
Simulations show that: (1) Strong seasonality is coherent with the persistence of HG populations in
India, independently of the geographical scale of the precipitation models, (2) Changes in AYP over
the mid period (Holocene) are not sufficient to explain the disappearance of HG populations in KutchSaurashtra (K-S) 4 ka, (3) Precipitation variability (VYP) over the short period (annual to decadal) is
the main parameter affecting population performance and overall ecosystem dynamics. To date,
sufficiently refined palaeo-climatic records do not exist for the study area, but higher VYP values 4 ka

  abstract={We have recently shown that classical planning problems can be characterized in terms of a width measure that is bounded and small for most planning benchmark domains when goals are restricted to single atoms. Two simple algorithms have been devised for exploiting this structure: Iterated Width (IW) for achieving atomic goals, that runs in time exponential in the problem width by performing a sequence of pruned breadth first searches, and Serialized IW (SIW) that uses IW in a greedy search for achieving conjunctive goals one goal at a time. While SIW does not use heuristic estimators of any sort, it manages to solve more problems than a Greedy BFS using a heuristic like hadd. Yet, it does not approach the performance of more recent planners like LAMA. In this short paper, we introduce two simple extension to IW and SIW that narrow the performance gap with state-of-the-art planners. The first involves changing the greedy search for achieving the goals one at a time, by a depth-first search that is able to backtrack. The second involves computing a relaxed plan once before going to the next subgoal for making the pruning in the breadth-first procedure less agressive, while keeping IW exponential in the width parameter. The empirical results are interesting as they follow from ideas that are very different from those used in current planners.}

The most effective approach for finding such plans is based on heuristic search guided by heuristics extracted automatically from the problem representation. In this thesis, we introduce alternative approaches for performing inference over the structure of planning problems that do not appeal to heuristic functions, nor to reductions to other formalisms such as SAT or CSP. We show that many of the standard benchmark domains can be solved with almost no search or a polynomially bounded amount of search, once the structure of planning problems is taken into account. In certain cases we can characterize this structure in terms of a novel width parameter for classical planning.}

In particular, we studya method to reduce the search-space by decomposing a problem into two partitions, where the second partition (ie, the subproblem) contains the fixed solution of the first (ie, the master). This type of approach is usually motivated by the presence of two sub-problems that are each more easily solved by different methods. Our work is motivated by methods for which it is nontrivial to return a strongno-good',Benders feasibility', or'optimality'cut. Instead, we focus our attention on a uni-directional decomposition approach. Instead of providing a relaxation of the sub-problem for the master problem, as in Benders decomposition, we provide an approximation of the sub-problem. Thus, we aim at finding good quality feasible solutions in the first iteration. While the quality of the approximation itself affects the impact of this approach, we illustrate that even using a simple approximation can havestrong positive impact on two examples: the Travelling Purchaser Problem and a Mine Planning Problem.}

In cost-optimal planning only the objective value of these heuristics is traditionally used to guide the search. However the primal solution, ie the operator counts, contains useful information. We exploit this information using a SAT-based approach which given an operator-count, either finds a valid plan; or generates a generalized landmark constraint violated by that count. We show that these generalized landmarks can be used to encode the perfect heuristic, h*, as a Mixed Integer Program. Our most interesting experimental result is that finding or refuting a sequence for an operator-count is most often empirically efficient, enabling a novel and promising approach to planning based on Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD).}

  abstract={The Atari 2600 games supported in the Arcade Learning Environment [Bellemare et al., 2013] all feature a known initial (RAM) state and actions that have deterministic effects. Classical planners, however, cannot be used off-the-shelf as there is no compact PDDL-model of the games, and action effects and goals are not known a priori. Indeed, there are no explicit goals, and the planner must select actions on line while interacting with a simulator that returns successor states and rewards. None of this precludes the use of blind lookahead algorithms for action selection like breadth-first search or Dijkstra’s yet such methods are not effective over large state spaces. We thus turn to a different class of planning methods introduced recently that have been shown to be effective for solving large planning problems but which do not require prior knowledge of state transitions, costs (rewards) or goals. The empirical results over 54 Atari games show that the simplest such algorithm performs at the level of UCT, the state-of-the-art planning method in this domain, and suggest the potential of width-based methods for planning with simulators when factored, compact action models are not available.}

Finally, dead-ends are formulas that are satisfied in states that make the goal unreachable. We introduce a preprocessing algorithm that computes traps in k-DNF form that is exponential in the k parameter, and show how the algorithm can be used to precompute invariants and dead-ends. We report also preliminary tests that illustrate the effectiveness of the preprocessing algorithm for identifying dead-end states, and compare it with the identification that follows from the use of the h1 and h2 heuristics that cannot be preprocessed, and must be computed at run time.}

  abstract={It has been shown recently that the performance of greedy best-first search (GBFS) for computing plans that are not necessarily optimal can be improved by adding forms of exploration when reaching heuristic plateaus: from random walks to local GBFS searches. In this work, we address this problem but using structural exploration methods resulting from the ideas of width-based search. Width-based methodsseek novel states, are not goal oriented, and their power has been shown recently in the Atari and GVG-AI video-games. We show first that width-based exploration in GBFS is more effective than GBFS with local GBFS search (GBFS-LS), and then proceed to formulate a simple and general computational framework where standard goal-oriented search (exploitation) and width-based search (structural exploration) are combined to yield a search scheme, best-first width search, that is better than both and which results in classical planning algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art planners.}

  abstract={The introduction of the concept of state novelty has advanced the state of the art in deterministic online planning in Atari-like problems and in planning with rewards in general, when rewards are defined on states. In classical planning, however, the success of novelty as the dichotomy between novel and non-novel states was somewhat limited. Until very recently, novelty-based methods were not able to successfully compete with state-of-the-art heuristic search based planners. In this work we adapt the concept of novelty to heuristic search planning, defining the novelty of a state with respect to its heuristic estimate. We extend the dichotomy between novel and non-novel states and quantify the novelty degree of state facts. We then show a variety of heuristics based on the concept of novelty and exploit the recently introduced best-first width search for satisficing classical planning. Finally, we empirically show the resulting planners to significantly improve the state of the art in satisficing planning.}

  abstract={It has been shown recently that heuristic and width-based search can be combined to produce planning algorithms with a performance that goes beyond the state-of-the-art. Such algorithms are based on best-first width search (BFWS), a plain best-first search set with evaluations functions combined lexicographically to break ties, some of which express novelty based preferences. In BFWS (f5), for example, the evaluation function f5 weights nodes by a novelty measure, breaking ties by the number of non-achieved goals. BFWS (f5) is a best-first algorithm, and hence, it is complete but not polynomial, and its performance doesn’t match the state of the art. In this work we show, however, that incomplete versions of BFWS (f5) where nodes with novelty greater than k are pruned, are not only polynomial but have an empirical performance that is better than both BFWS (f5) and state-of-the-art planners. This is shown by considering all the international planning competition instances. This is the first time where polynomial algorithms with meaningful bounds are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in planning. Practical and theoretical implications of this empirical finding are briefly sketched.}

  abstract={Classical planning is concerned with problems where a goal needs to be reached from a known initial state by doing actions with deterministic,
known effects. Classical planners, however, deal only with classical problems that can be expressed in declarative planning languages such as STRIPS
or PDDL. This prevents their use on problems that are not easy to model declaratively or whose dynamics are given via simulations. Simulators do not
provide a declarative representation of actions, but simply return successor states. The question we address in this paper is: can a planner that has access to the structure of states and goals only, approach the performance of planners that also have access to the structure of actions expressed in PDDL? To answer this, we develop domain-independent, black box planning algorithms that completely ignore action structure, and show that they match the performance of state-of-the-art classical planners on the standard planning benchmarks. Effective black box algorithms open up new possibilities for modeling and for expressing control knowledge, which we also illustrate.

A transparent planning task is defined as a task where the objective of the agent is to communicate its true goal to observers, thereby making its intentions and its action selection transparent. We formally define and model these tasks as Goal POMDPs where the state space is the Cartesian product of the states of the world and a given set of hypothetical goals. Action effects are deterministic in the world states of the problem but probabilistic in the observer’s beliefs. Transition probabilities are obtained from making a call to a model–based plan recognition algorithm, which we refer to as an observer stereotype. We propose an action selection strategy via on–line planning that seeks actions to quickly convey the goal being pursued to an observer assumed to fit a given stereotype. In order to keep run–times feasible, we propose a novel model–based plan recognition algorithm that approximates well–known probabilistic plan recognition methods. The resulting on–line planner, after being evaluated over a diverse set of domains and three different observer stereotypes, is found to convey goal information faster than purely goal–directed planners.}

Best-First Width Search (BFWS) is one of the most successful satisficing width-based algorithms, as it strikes a good balance between an effective exploration based on a measure of state novelty and the exploitation provided by traditional goal-directed heuristics. Several conceptually interesting BFWS variants have recently been shown to offer state-of-the-art performance, including a polynomial-time BFWS planner which is incomplete but fast and effective, and a black-box BFWS planner that can plan efficiently with simulators, ie when the transition function of the problem is represented as a blackbox function. In this paper, we describe six BFWS planners involving these variations that we have entered into the 2018 International Planning Competition.}

  abstract={Epistemic planning---planning with knowledge and belief---is essential in many multi-agent and human-agent interaction domains. Most state-of-the-art epistemic planners solve this problem by compiling to propositional classical planning, for example, generating all possible knowledge atoms, or compiling epistemic formula to normal forms. However, these methods become computationally infeasible as problems grow. In this paper, we decompose epistemic planning by delegating reasoning about epistemic formula to an external solver. We do this by modelling the problem using\emph {functional STRIPS}, which is more expressive than standard STRIPS and supports the use of external, black-box functions within action models. Exploiting recent work that demonstrates the relationship between what an agentsees' and what it knows, we allow modellers to provide new implementations of externals functions. These define what agents see in their environment, allowing new epistemic logics to be defined without changing the planner. As a result, it increases the capability and flexibility of the epistemic model itself, and avoids the exponential pre-compilation step. We ran evaluations on well-known epistemic planning benchmarks to compare with an existing state-of-the-art planner, and on new scenarios based on different external functions. The results show that our planner scales significantly better than the state-of-the-art planner against which we compared, and can express problems more succinctly.}

  \\n\\n The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a formal knowledge representation language designed to express planning models. Developed by the planning research community as a means of facilitating systems comparison, it has become a de-facto standard input language of many planning systems, although it is not the only modelling language for planning. Several variants of PDDL have emerged that capture planning problems of different natures and complexities, with a focus on deterministic problems.

  \\n\\n The purpose of this book is two-fold. First, we present a unified and current account of PDDL, covering the subsets of PDDL that express discrete, numeric, temporal, and hybrid planning. Second, we want to introduce readers to the art of modelling planning problems in this language, through educational examples that demonstrate how PDDL is used to model realistic planning problems. The book is intended for advanced students and researchers in AI who want to dive into the mechanics of AI planning, as well as those who want to be able to use AI planning systems without an in-depth explanation of the algorithms and implementation techniques they use.

In this paper, we propose a framework for solving the probabilistic goal recognition problem using process mining techniques for discovering models that describe the observed behavior and diagnosing deviations between the discovered models and observations. The framework imitates the principles of observational learning, one of the core mechanisms of social learning exhibited by humans, and relaxes the above assumptions.

A newly developed low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) was tested on wines made from grapevines exposed to smoke in field trials. E-nose readings were obtained from wines from five experimental treatments: (i) low-density smoke exposure (LS), (ii) high-density smoke exposure (HS), (iii) high-density smoke exposure with in-canopy misting (HSM), and two controls: (iv) control (C; no smoke treatment) and (v) control with in-canopy misting (CM; no smoke treatment). These e-nose readings were used as inputs for machine learning algorithms to obtain a classification model, with treatments as targets and seven neurons, with 97\% accuracy in the classification of 300 samples into treatments as targets (Model 1). Models 2 to 4 used 10 neurons, with 20 glycoconjugates and 10 volatile phenols as targets, measured: in berries one hour after smoke (Model 2; R = 0.98; R2 = 0.95; b = 0.97); in berries at harvest (Model 3; R = 0.99; R2 = 0.97; b = 0.96); in wines (Model 4; R = 0.99; R2 = 0.98; b = 0.98). Model 5 was based on the intensity of 12 wine descriptors determined via a consumer sensory test (Model 5; R = 0.98; R2 = 0.96; b = 0.97). These models could be used by winemakers to assess near real-time smoke contamination levels and to implement amelioration strategies to minimize smoke taint in wines following bushfires.}
