abstract: The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI), together with robotics,
  sensors, sensor networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and machine/deep learning modeling,
  has reached the forefront of research activities, moving towards the goal of increasing
  the efficiency in a multitude of applications and purposes related to environmental
  sciences. The development and deployment of AI tools requires specific considerations,
  approaches, and methodologies for their effective and accurate applications. This
  Special Issue focused on the applications of AI to environmental systems related
  to hazard assessment in urban, agriculture, and forestry areas.
