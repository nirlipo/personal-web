abstract: 'In complex tasks (beyond a single targeted controller) requiring robots
  to collaborate with multiple human users, two challenges arise: complex tasks are
  often composed of multiple behaviors which can only be evaluated as a collective
  (a meta-behavior) and user preferences often differ between individuals, yet successful
  interactions are expected across groups. To address these challenges, we formulate
  a set-wise preference learning problem, and validate a cost function that captures
  human group preferences for complex collaborative robotic tasks (cobotics). We develop
  a sparse optimization formulation to introduce a distinctiveness metric that aggregates
  individuals with similar preference profiles. Analysis of anonymized unlabelled
  preferences provides further insight into group preferences. Identification of the
  mode average most-preferred meta-behavior and minimum covariance bound allows us
  to analyze group cohesion. A user study with 43 participants is used to validate
  group preference profiles.'
