abstract: "The automatic generation of realistic behaviour such as tactical intercepts for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in air combat is a challenging problem. State-of-the-art solutions propose hand–crafted algorithms and heuristics whose performance depends heavily on the initial conditions and specific aerodynamic characteristics of the UAVs involved. This demo shows the ability of domain–independent planners, embedded into simulators, to generate on–line, feed–forward, control signals that steer simulated aircraft as best suits the situation."
