abstract: We investigate the application of state-of-the-art goal recognition techniques
  for behaviour recognition over complex continuous domains using model predictive
  control (MPC) for trajectory generation. We formally define the problem of kinodynamic
  behaviour recognition and establish a set of baseline behaviours and performance
  measures in the complex domain of unmanned aerial maneuvers. We evaluate how well
  our approach performs over a range of standard aerial maneuvers and representative
  initial configurations of varying complexity. The work also highlights future research
  directions in compound model-based behaviour recognition and team behaviour recognition
  where multiple agents may be acting simultaneously.
