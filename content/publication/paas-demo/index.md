abstract: Planning as a service (PaaS) provides an extendable API to deploy planners
  online in local or cloud servers. The service provides a queue manager to control
  a set of workers, which can easily be extended with one of several planners available
  in PLANUTILS. PaaS is designed to overcome the limitations of the existing online
  solver.planning.domains interface and widen the adoption of planning technology
  in education, research, and industry.
