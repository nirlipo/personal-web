abstract: Width-based algorithms search for solutions through a general definition
  of state novelty. These algorithms have been shown to result in state-of-the-art
  performance in classical planning, and have been successfully applied to model-based
  and model-free settings where the dynamics of the problem are given through simulation
  engines. Width-based algorithms performance is understood theoretically through
  the notion of planning width, providing polynomial guarantees on their runtime and
  memory consumption. To facilitate synergies across research communities, this paper
  summarizes the area of width-based planning, and surveys current and future research
  directions.
