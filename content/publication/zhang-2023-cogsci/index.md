abstract: Understanding problem solving or planning has been a shared challenge for
  both AI and cognitive science since the birth of both fields. We explore the extent
  to which modern planners from the field of AI can account for human performance
  on the Tower of London (TOL) task, a close relative of the Tower of Hanoi problem
  that has been extensively studied by psychologists. We characterize the task using
  the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and evaluate an adaptive online planner
  and a family of well-known planners, including online planners, optimal planners
  and satisficing planners. Each planner is evaluated based on its ability to predict
  the actions and planning times of participants in a new behavioral experiment. Our
  results suggest that participants use a range of strategies but that an adaptive
  lookahead planner provides the best overall account of both human actions and human
  planning times. This finding is consistent with the view that humans differ from
  standard AI planners by integrating a mechanism for evidence accumulation.
