abstract: 'The Model AI Assignments session seeks to gather and dis-seminate the best assignment designs of the Artificial In-telligence (AI) Education community. Recognizing that as-signments form the core of student learning experience, we here present abstracts of five AI assignments from the 2024 session that are easily adoptable, playfully engaging, and flexible for a variety of instructor needs.
