 abstract = {The current study on duality mapping proposed by Suda (2013) is a viable strategy to
turn progression (forward search) into regression (backward search), and the experiment
results suggest that the dual versions of standard IPCs benchmark domains are quite
difficult to solve for heuristic-based search. We adopt width-based search (IW and SIW)
in this thesis to test the performance on dual problems. The experiment results show
that dual problems can be solved efficiently when the goal state is restricted to single
fluent, but it becomes challenging when the goal state contains conjunctive fluents.
Then, we turn serialized iterated width, SIW, best-first width search with the evaluation
function f 5, BFWS(f5), and the polynomial variants of BFWS(f5), k-BFWS(f5) from
progression into regression by modifying the state space. Results show that the backward
versions are uncompetitive with the forward versions but still outperform in some IPCs
benchmark domains in all SIW, BFWS(f5) and k-BFWS(f5).
Furthermore, we build a bidirectional search, k-BFWBS by integrating forward and
backward k-BFWS(f5) with six different combinations. Although these six combinations
cannot solve more problems than only adopting forward k -BFWS(f 5) among tested IPCs
benchmark domains, they are distinctive. However, if we run forward k -BFWS(f5) first
and then run backward k-BFWS(f5), it outperforms only running forward k-BFWS(f5),
which proves that backward search is useful.
All results in this thesis indicate that although backward search is uncompetitive and
multiple issues still exist, it is still worthy of having a deep exploration of backward
search since it not only finds more plans in some domains but also proposes a different
perspective to analyse classical planning tasks. Meanwhile, we point out the weaknesses
of backward search and give relevant solutions, and a new method complete domain is
presented to perfect backward search.},
