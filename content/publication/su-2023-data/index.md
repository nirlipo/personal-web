abstract: A transhumeral prosthesis restores missing anatomical segments below the
  shoulder, including the hand. Active prostheses utilize real-valued, continuous
  sensor data to recognize patient target poses, or goals, and proactively move the
  artificial limb. Previous studies have examined how well the data collected in stationary
  poses, without considering the time steps, can help discriminate the goals. In this
  case study paper, we focus on using time series data from surface electromyography
  electrodes and kinematic sensors to sequentially recognize patients' goals. Our
  approach involves transforming the data into discrete events and training an existing
  process mining-based goal recognition system. Results from data collected in a virtual
  reality setting with ten subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
  goal recognition approach, which achieves significantly better precision and recall
  than the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and is less confident when
  wrong, which is beneficial when approximating smoother movements of prostheses.
