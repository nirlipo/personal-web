abstract: 'This thesis explores the intersection between planning and learning methods for autonomous
sequential decision-making. Planning is a model-based approach to autonomous sequential
decision-making where action policies are derived automatically through a model of an en-
vironment. Alternatively, learning methods learn action policies through interaction with an
environment. The planning and learning approaches can be likened to current theories of human
cognition which propose a fast and associative system works in conjunction with a slow and
deliberative one. From this observation previous work has conjectured that in order to create
intelligent systems that are more general and robust than existing ones, a combination of planning
and learning methods may be required.
Two common high-level approaches for combining planning and learning are to use learning to
help guide the search effort of planners and to use planners to teach learning algorithms. This
thesis examines these two high-level approaches through the topics of cost-to-go approxima-
tions, symbolic regression and imitation. We propose and study a number of new algorithms
which provide new insights into methods that combine planning and learning, namely, we intro-
duce methods for learning value and policy functions from lookeaheads; learning from single
demonstrations produced by planners; and learning heuristics for planning algorithms.
