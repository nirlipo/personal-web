This paper implements a cost-effective pest detection method that can be used for microfarmers
by using a low-cost electronic nose and machine learning modelling. This method
was realized by conducting a controlled experiment and making measurements, we designed
and conducted controlled experiment using wheat and an oat aphid as experimental materials,
while measurements were made using E-nose and an open gas exchange system to acquire
data sets used for model construction.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to develop three models including two
classification models and one regression model. These classification models are able to
classify the level of pest infestation based on E-nose measurements and the regression model
can predict three physiological parameters including photosynthesis, stomatal conductance
and transpiration based on E-nose measurements. Both classification models achieve high
accuracy around 98% and the best one of them was confirmed through model evaluation and
analysis to have no over-fitting or under-fitting problems. The regression model has the
performance of overall correlation coefficient 0.79. Model evaluation were analyzed based on
accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and correlation coefficient. These three models enable
the method implemented in this study to detect pests efficiently and reliably.},
