abstract: 'Goal Recognition (GR) is a research problem that studies ways to infer the goal of an intelligent agent based on its observed behavior and knowledge of the environment in which the agent operates. A common assumption of GR is that the environment is static. However, in many real-world scenarios, for example, recognizing customers’ preferences, it is necessary to recognize the goals of multiple agents or multiple goals of a single agent over an extended period. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the environment to change throughout a series of goal recognition tasks. This paper presents three process mining-based solutions to the problem of adaptive GR in a changing environment implemented as different control strategies of a system for solving standard GR problems. As a standard GR system that gets controlled, we use the system grounded in process mining techniques, as it can adjust its internal GR mechanisms based on data collected while observing the operating agents. We evaluated our control strategies over synthetic and real-world datasets. The synthetic datasets were generated using the extended version of the Goal Recognition Amidst Changing Environments (GRACE) tool. The datasets account for different types of changes and drifts in the environment. The evaluation results demonstrate a trade-off between the GR performance over time and the effort invested in adaptations of the GR mechanisms of the system, showing that few well-planned adaptations can lead to a consistently high GR performance.'
