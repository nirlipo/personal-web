abstract: The aim of decentralised multi-agent (DMA) planning is to coordinate a set
  of agents to jointly achieve a goal while preserving their privacy. Blind search
  algorithms, such as width-based search, have recently proved to be very effective
  in the context of centralised automated planning, especially when combined with
  goal-oriented techniques. In this paper, we discuss a recent line of research in
  which the usage of width-based search has been extensively studied in the context
  of DMA planning, addressing the challenges related to the agents' privacy and performance.
