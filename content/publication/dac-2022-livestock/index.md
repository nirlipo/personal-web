abstract: 'Farm livestock identification and welfare assessment using non-invasive
  digital technology have gained interest in agriculture in the last decade, especially
  for accurate traceability. This study aimed to develop a face recognition system
  for dairy farm cows using advanced deep-learning models and computer vision techniques.
  This approach is non-invasive and potentially applicable to other farm animals of
  importance for identification and welfare assessment. The video analysis pipeline
  follows standard human face recognition systems made of four significant steps:
  (i) face detection, (ii) face cropping, (iii) face encoding, and (iv) face lookup.
  Three deep learning (DL) models were used within the analysis pipeline: (i) face
  detector, (ii) landmark predictor, and (iii) face encoder. All DL models were finetuned
  through transfer learning on a dairy cow dataset collected from a robotic dairy
  farm located in the Dookie campus at The University of Melbourne, Australia. Results
  showed that the accuracy across videos from 89 different dairy cows achieved an
  overall accuracy of 84%. The computer program developed may be deployed on edge
  devices, and it was tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano board with a camera stream. Furthermore,
  it could be integrated into welfare assessment previously developed by our research
  group.'
