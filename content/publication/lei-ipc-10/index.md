abstract: It has been shown recently that successful techniques in classical planning,
  such as goal-oriented heuristics and landmarks, can improve the ability to compute
  planning programs for generalized planning (GP) problems. Besides fact landmarks,
  other ideas in classical planning have not been introduced to generalized planning,
  such as novelty-based search. In this paper, we present novelty-based generalized
  planning solvers, which prune a newly generated planning program if its most frequent
  action repetition is greater than a given bound v, implemented by novelty-based
  Progressive Generalized Planning PGP(v). Besides, we introduce new structural program
  restrictions to scale up the search.
