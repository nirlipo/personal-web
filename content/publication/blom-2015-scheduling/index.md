abstract: "In open-pit mining operations, there are several levels of planning, each of which passes down restrictions to the level below. Each planning task is to determine the order in which material should be mined and how it should be processed, such that blending and utilisation targets are met. The mining operations are subject to various constraints on equipment use, maintenance and other resources. In this paper, we present a demo for two levels of planning: short-term scheduling and operations planning. The short-term schedule determines the blocks which should be mined, and when. The operational planners have the task of enacting the plans at a finer time horizon. Our system computes a set of schedules that can then be visualised in the form of tables, charts, and maps to support human expert planners."
