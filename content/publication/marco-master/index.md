abstract: 'This work explores the use of Reinforcement Learning as a tool for designing policies for
systems under uncertainty. Our research investigates the efficacy of Reinforcement Learning
to design policies, and how Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), can improve the
quality of Reinforcement Learning derived policies in uncertain systems. The Victorian
electricity market is used as a case study, where policies have been designed to support
the transition to an environmentally sustainable future. A novel integration of the DAPP
framework into Reinforcement Learning algorithms is proposed, to bolster the efficacy and
robustness of Reinforcement Learning derived policies. Experimentation is also performed
to better understand the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) used by the
DAPP framework to computationally design its policies. Our discussion on MOEAs evaluates
what strengths they provide the DAPP framework for developing robust policies, and their
implications for our proposed DAPP-Reinforcement Learning method.
A comparative analysis is conducted on the quality of policies designed using only Reinforce-
ment Learning techniques, compared to policies designed using our DAPP-Reinforcement
Learning method, in addition to various baseline policies. Our results show policies designed
by the DAPP-Reinforcement Learning method on average increase Victoriaâ€™s renewable elec-
tricity utilisation by 23%, and decrease household greenhouse gas emissions by 28%, when
compared to the policies derived via only Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Through crit-
ical analysis of the results, this work conveys how the strengths of the DAPP framework
can be combined with Reinforcement Learning to develop more robust policies for systems
under uncertainty.
