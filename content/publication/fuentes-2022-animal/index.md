abstract: "Digitally extracted biometrics from visible videos of farm animals could\
  \ be used to automatically assess animal welfare, contributing to the future of\
  \ automated veterinary support systems. This study proposed using non-invasive video\
  \ acquisition and biometric analysis of dairy cows in a robotic dairy farm (RDF)\
  \ located at the Dookie campus, The University of Melbourne, Australia. Data extracted\
  \ from dairy cows were used to develop two machine learning models: a biometrics\
  \ regression model (Model 1) targeting (i) somatic cell count, (ii) weight, (iii)\
  \ rumination, and (iv) feed intake and a classification model (Model 2) mapping\
  \ features from dairy cow's face to predict animal age. Results showed that Model\
  \ 1 achieved a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.96), slope (b = 0.96), and performance,\
  \ and Model 2 had high accuracy (98%), low error (2%), and high performance without\
  \ signs of under or overfitting. Models developed in this study can be used in parallel\
  \ with other models to assess milk productivity, quality traits, and welfare for\
  \ RDF and conventional dairy farms."
