abstract: The problem of goal recognition requests to automatically infer an accurate
  probability distribution over possible goals an autonomous agent is attempting to
  achieve in the environment. The state-of-the-art approaches for goal recognition
  operate under full knowledge of the environment and possible operations the agent
  can take. This knowledge, however, is often not available in real-world applications.
  Given historical observations of the agents' behaviors in the environment, we learn
  skill models that capture how the agents achieved the goals in the past. Next, given
  fresh observations of an agent, we infer their goals by diagnosing deviations between
  the observations and all the available skill models. We present a framework that
  serves as an outline for implementing such data-driven goal recognition systems
  and its instance system implemented using process mining techniques. The evaluations
  we conducted using our publicly available implementation confirm that the approach
  is well-defined, i.e., all system parameters impact its performance, has high accuracy
  over a wide range of synthetic and real-world domains, which is comparable with
  the more knowledge-demanding state-of-the-art approaches, and operates fast.
