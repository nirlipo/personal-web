 abstract = { This short paper describes the main components in a width-based planner that relies on compilations of the problem of efficiently grounding action schemas 
to that of enumerating the stable models of an Answer Set Program (ASP). We observe that this ``pre-processing'' component, very often overlooked, is of significant importance to analyze the behavior of planning algorithms that rely on grounded representations of planning problem instances.},
