abstract: " This short paper describes the main components in a width-based planner\
  \ that relies on compilations of the problem of efficiently grounding action schemas\
  \  to that of enumerating the stable models of an Answer Set Program (ASP). We observe\
  \ that this ``pre-processing'' component, very often overlooked, is of significant\
  \ importance to analyze the behavior of planning algorithms that rely on grounded\
  \ representations of planning problem instances."
