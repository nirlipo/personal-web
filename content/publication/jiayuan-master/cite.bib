 abstract = {Autonomous system has an increasingly important role in small-scale urban agriculture. It has the
potential to enable people without professional agricultural skills to utilize the under-exploited urban
space on top of, or between the urban buildings to increase food production. It is important for global
food security given the background of increasing global population and decreasing total arable land in
the future. The aim of this research is to propose the classical planning approach to automate an existing
low-cost robotic platform: Farmbot, which is designed for small-scale backyard farming and evaluate the
feasibility of this approach. Specifically, we first propose the appropriate planning domain and problems
on Farmbot using the planning domain definition language (PDDL) to allow the common tasks on the
Farmbot to be achieved by automatically generated plans. Then, we explore the meaningful way to apply
plan metric in order to optimize those plans. Later, we propose an agent planning program, which enables
the automatic formulation of a sequence of planning problems and continuous plan generation over the
planning domain on Farmbot. A ROS project is developed to incorporate these planning components with
a controlling interface to enable plan dispatching and execution. The results and evaluation from multiple
experiments, including a benchmarking and a simulation show the feasibility of such an approach and also
validate our PDDL modelling, our agent planning program, the approach we apply plan metric to optimize
the plans and the entire system in the ROS project. This project introduces a new research problem and
increases the uptake of planning technology in real-world problems, most importantly it opens up many
options and opportunities for future research topics.},
