abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is a research problem that studies ways to infer the
  goal of an intelligent agent based on its observed behavior and knowledge of the
  environment. A common assumption of GR is that the underlying environment is stationary.
  However, in many real-world scenarios, it is necessary to recognize agents' goals
  over extended periods. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the environment
  will change throughout a series of goal recognition tasks. This paper introduces
  the problem of continuous GR over a changing environment. The solution to this problem
  is a GR system capable of recognizing agents' goals over an extended period where
  the environment in which the agents operate changes. To support the evaluation of
  candidate solutions to this new GR problem, in this paper, we present the Goal Recognition
  Amidst Changing Environments (GRACE) tool for generating instances of the new problem.
  Specifically, the tool can be configured to generate GR problems that account for
  different environmental changes and drifts. GRACE can generate a series of modified
  environments over discrete time steps and the data induced by agents operating in
  the environment while completing different goals.
