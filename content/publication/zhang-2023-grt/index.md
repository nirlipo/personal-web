abstract: Goal recognition has been extensively studied by AI researchers, but most
  algorithms take only observed actions as input. Here we argue that the time taken
  to carry out these actions provides an additional signal that supports goal recognition.
  We present a behavioral experiment confirming that people use timing information
  in this way, and develop and evaluate a goal recognition algorithm that is sensitive
  to both actions and timing information. Our results suggest that existing goal recognition
  algorithms can be improved by incorporating a model of planning time on both synthetic
  data and human data, and that these improvements can be substantial in scenarios
  in which relatively few actions have been observed.
