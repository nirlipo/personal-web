  description = "**Text of Award**: Nir Lipovetzky takes a new, and very original, look at     automated planning: how to reason your way to a plan, instead of      searching (blindly or heuristically) for it. First, he has developed a range of novel inference techniques that, combined,      produce classical planners that can work with very little       backtracking -- in many cases none at all -- and perform well enough to be awarded at two IPCs.  Second, he has invented a      novel measure of the hardness of a planning problem, called       \"width\", and has shown that by properly exploiting it, a simple       blind search can do as well as the best-performing heuristic       search planners."
