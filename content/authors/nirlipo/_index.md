I am an Associate Professor in Artificial intelligencee at the School of [Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I'm a member of the [Agent Lab group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/agentlab/) and the [Digital Agriculture, Food and Wine](https://fvas.unimelb.edu.au/research/groups/digital-agriculture-food-and-wine) lab. 

My research focuses on how to introduce different approaches to the problem of inference in **sequential decision problems**, as well as applications to **autonomous systems in agriculture**.

I completed my PhD at the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), Universitat Pompeu Fabra, under the supervision of Prof. [Hector Geffner](http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~hgeffner/). I was a research fellow for 3 years under the supervision of Prof. [Peter Stuckey](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/pstuckey/) and Prof. [Adrian Pearce](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/adrianrp/), working on solving [Mining Scheduling](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/agentlab/projects/mining) problems through automated planning, constraint programming and operations research techniques.
